INTENT
======
Set up a CPAN mirror that, rather than tarballs, serves binaries as
used by varies package managers like RPM, MDK, apt, ports, etc.


CLIENTS
=======
The use of this mirror would be totally outside the scope of the 
current CPAN, other than that it shares it's name, and similar content.
All the work installing these packages should be done by the package
managers of the various operating systems.
This mirror is merely a 'source' to add to the configuration of the
package manager to retrieve perl modules from.

CONTENT
=======
Content must be provided, and can be done so easily by having build
farms (or volunteers) upload converted distributions. Automation can
be done quite easily using CPANPLUS and it's Dist::FOO output filter.

The content should focus primarily on being installable via a package
manager, and only secondarily try to adhere to all the administrative
requirements of such packagemanagers (ie, licenses, upstream authors,
changelogs, etc)

Each distribution on CPAN will have a set of binary releases; one per
set of operating system and configuration options.

TODO
====
* write CPANPLUS::Dist::* plugins to facilitate package managers
    (ports is done, par and deb are close)
* set up a dir structure with indexes and the like for every supported
    package manager
* set up buildfarms (or volunteers) to create these packages
* find a way to upload packages to the server
